## 💻 **What I’m Working On**

I’m currently building a comprehensive Windows-based homelab to simulate enterprise IT environments. My homelab projects focus on:

- **Virtualization**: Setting up VMs with Hyper-V to host multiple operating systems.
- **Networking**: Configuring virtual networks using pfSense, DHCP, DNS, and firewalls.
- **Active Directory**: Managing users, OUs, and group policies through AD services.
- **Security Tools**: Implementing IDS (Snort), firewalls, and antivirus to safeguard the network.
- **Penetration Testing**: Using tools like Kali Linux and Metasploit to test network defenses.
- **Automation**: Writing PowerShell and Bash scripts to automate administrative tasks.
